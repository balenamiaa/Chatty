# System Architecture

## Core Architecture

Chatty is built on a modern, layered architecture that prioritizes security, real-time communication, and scalability. The system is designed as a monolithic application with clear boundaries between components, making it maintainable and potentially ready for future microservices migration if needed.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Security-First Design**
   - End-to-end encryption ensures message privacy
   - Zero-knowledge architecture prevents server access to content
   - Strong authentication and authorization at all layers
   - Secure key management with regular rotation

2. **Real-time Communication**
   - WebSocket-based messaging for instant delivery
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
   - Presence system for user status tracking
   - WebRTC integration for voice/video calls

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Client-side encryption of all sensitive data
   - Encrypted file storage
   - Secure key exchange protocols
   - Minimal metadata storage

### System Components

#### Backend Services

The backend is organized into distinct service layers:

1. **API Layer**
   - Handles HTTP requests using minimal APIs
   - Manages authentication and authorization
   - Validates incoming requests
   - Routes to appropriate services

2. **Real-time Layer**
   - Manages WebSocket connections
   - Handles real-time event distribution
   - Maintains connection state
   - Manages presence information

3. **Service Layer**
   - Implements business logic
   - Manages transactions
   - Handles data access
   - Publishes domain events

4. **Storage Layer**
   - Manages database operations
   - Handles file storage
   - Implements caching
   - Manages data encryption

#### Infrastructure Components

1. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL for relational data
   - Optimized for real-time operations
   - Supports encrypted storage
   - Handles complex relationships

2. **File Storage**
   - Local file system storage
   - Encrypted file handling
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Cleanup management

3. **Caching**
   - In-memory caching for performance
   - Distributed caching support
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Session state management

### Communication Patterns

#### Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses events for:
- Real-time updates
- System state changes
- Background processing
- Cross-component communication

#### Message Flow

1. **Client to Server**
   - Authentication
   - Request validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling

2. **Server to Client**
   - Real-time updates
   - Event notifications
   - Status changes
   - Error responses

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Resource optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization
   - Caching strategies

2. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless design
   - Distributed caching support
   - Background job processing
   - Load balancing ready

### Security Architecture

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Device verification
   - Session management

2. **Encryption Layer**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Key rotation
   - Secure key storage
   - Zero-knowledge design

3. **Authorization Layer**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Context-based authorization
   - Audit logging

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Health Monitoring**
   - Service health checks
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Resource usage

2. **Background Processing**
   - Message cleanup
   - File maintenance
   - Key rotation
   - Cache management

### Development Considerations

1. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Interface-driven design
   - Dependency injection

2. **Error Handling**
   - Strongly typed errors
   - Consistent error responses
   - Proper logging
   - Recovery strategies

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

### Future Extensibility

The architecture supports future enhancements:
- Microservices migration path
- Additional authentication methods
- New message types
- Extended file handling
